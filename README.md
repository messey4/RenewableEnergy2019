# RenewableEnergy2019

## INTRODUCTION
This is a dashboard that shows the breakdown and performance of renewable energy consumption and invesments. 

**_Disclaimer_** : I only worked on the visualization of the data set, the data was already analyzed with pivot tables.

## Data Visualization
The first chart on the left shows how much renewable energy has grown over the years.

The map chart on the top right gives the big picture of renewable energy regional focus in 2019.
    *The dashboard, with the help of the slicers, is interactive so it enables users select sub-data and visualizes it.
    *In map chart enables the user select specific continents and zooms into each continent to explore the data further.
    *The map chart contains a hyperlink that connects the drilldown page which expands the map data further.
    *The drilldown page shows the top five countries in the capacity trend. It also shows the energy generation between renewable and           non-renewable energy from 2000-2017.
    *The drilldown shows the relationship between Solar energy , Geo-thermal energy and wind energy between the years 2007-2017.

The dougnut charts shows the different electricity capacities(MW) consumed in 2000, 2014 and 2019.

The bottom left chart shows the total global consumption of energy in thousands, from 1965 through to 2017. It also breaks down the total energy consumed into energy quantities like Wind, Solar, Hydropower traditional biofuels and other.

The bottom-middle chart shows the top five countries that invested money into renewable energy and the amount they invested, in millions. The chart also displays information based on the years selected in the slicer, from 2013-2017.

The bottom-right chart displays the number of jobs in renewable energy that have been provided from 2013-2018

## Insights
From this dashboard, we can see that:
  1. The use of renewable energy has tremendously increased over the years.
  2. Overall, Asia was the largest consumer of renewable energy in 2019, It consumed 5,876,348 (MW) capacity.
  3. Africa was the least consumer of renewable energy in 2019, It consumed 70,187 (MW) capacity.
  4. Solar energy became the most consumed since the ending of 2009 and has only progrssed since then.
  5. Brazil has always been in the top five countries investing in renewable energy from 2013-2017.
  6. Nigeria invested the highest amount in 2017, with $4,961.00, beating Argetina in 2014 that invested $4,402.00
  7. Solar energy has provided the most jobs in renewable energy from 2013-2018 while wind energy provided the lest.
